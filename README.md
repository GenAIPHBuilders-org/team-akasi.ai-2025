## 🧠 About Akasi.ai
**Akasi.ai** is an AI-powered health management solution that serves as your personal health guardian. We help Filipinos better manage chronic health conditions by bringing order to the chaos of health management - from tracking medications and diet to providing personalized insights and reminders.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work of Team Akasi.ai for the GenAI PHBuilders Hackathon 2025. We're creating an AI-powered health management solution focused on helping Filipinos better manage chronic health conditions.

## This isn't just an idea for us - we're patient zero! 🙂
