## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

Akasi.ai leverages a modern tech stack to deliver an intelligent and responsive health management experience. Our architecture is designed around a multi-agent system to handle various aspects of health data processing and user interaction.

![Akasi.ai Architecture](https://pcygqqevesxpeeyxxfjw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/users/Medical%20Docs/user_1/akasi.ai%20Pitch%20Deck%20-%20Agentic%20AI%20Hackathon%202025%20(6).png)


### Core Technologies

**Platform Framework:** FastHTML - The entire platform is built using FastHTML, allowing for rapid development of dynamic web applications purely in Python.

**AI Agent Framework:** LangGraph - We use LangGraph to build and orchestrate our multi-agent AI system, managing complex workflows for health information processing.
- **Agent 1:** Responsible for empathetically gathering health information from the user.
- **Agent 2:** Formats the gathered information into a structured and usable form for the Health Diary and platform display. (IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE)

**Large Language Model (LLM):** Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 via AWS Bedrock - Powers the intelligence of our AI agents, enabling natural language understanding and generation.

### Frontend Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **DaisyUI** - A component library for Tailwind CSS to accelerate UI development.
- **Standard JS and CSS** for additional interactivity and custom styling.

### Backend (Database & Authentication)
**Supabase** - Provides robust backend services including a PostgreSQL database, user authentication, and storage.

### Simplified Architecture Overview

Below is a simplified overview of our multi-agent architecture:

```

## üó∫Ô∏è AI Agent Evaluation & Quality Assurance:
Rigorous evaluation is critical for healthcare AI,  we're implementing comprehensive testing methodologies to ensure both Agent 1 and Agent 2 are reliable, measurable, and continuously improving rather than relying on unpredictable "AI magic." 

Our evaluation implementation includes conversation quality metrics (information extraction accuracy, completion rates, and boundary compliance), user intent analysis to optimize conversation flows for common scenarios, performance benchmarking with structured testing and defined SLAs, and iterative optimization through data-driven improvements based on real user interaction patterns and feedback loops.

## üîê Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to securely manage external service credentials and configurations.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following keys:

```bash
# Supabase - DONT WORRY THIS IS A DISPOSABLE SUPABASE INSTANCE YOU CAN USE OUR  KEYS
SUPABASE_URL_NEW="https://pcygqqevesxpeeyxxfjw.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_NEW="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBjeWdxcWV2ZXN4cGVleXh4Zmp3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDY4Njc3NzMsImV4cCI6MjA2MjQ0Mzc3M30.HRKiFi4z4Z3x0A7zuUEbeFbQT5NhVBEssvdWZR_iUHU"

```

## üöÄ Getting Started: Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get Akasi.ai running on your local machine:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisites: AWS Bedrock Setup Required**

**Important:** Akasi.ai currently requires AWS Bedrock for AI functionality. We haven't yet enabled support for other LLM providers through OpenRouter, so AWS Bedrock is mandatory for the application to work.

**Before proceeding with installation, you must:**

1. **Create an AWS Account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Enable AWS Bedrock Service** in your AWS account
3. **Request Access to Anthropic Models** in AWS Bedrock:
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 (primary model)
   - Claude 3.7 Sonnet (for image analysis)
   - Claude 4 variants (if available in your region)
4. **Set up IAM Permissions** for Bedrock access
5. **Generate AWS Access Keys** with appropriate Bedrock permissions

**AWS Setup Steps:**
- Navigate to AWS Bedrock console
- Request model access for Anthropic Claude models
- Create IAM user/role with `bedrock:InvokeModel` permissions
- Generate access keys for your application

Once AWS Bedrock is properly configured, add your AWS credentials to the environment variables as specified in the Environment Variables section.

### 1. Fork the Repository (Optional but Recommended for Contribution)
If you plan to contribute or experiment, start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenAIPHBuilders-org/team-akasi.ai-2025.git
cd team-akasi.ai-2025
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) or add the necessary variables as specified in the "Environment Variables" section below.

### 6. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application should now be running, and you can access it as indicated by the FastHTML server output (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000).
